Automated sudoku solver implemented during the technex ctf for doku and doku2 tasks. 
Involves receiving puzzle, solving and sending the solved puzzle which when done 50 times returns the flag.
Due to poor internet connection and receiving partial data from the TCPP/IP request, a check was implemented on the expected size of each input. 

Experience gained - 
 * web sockets
 * communication protocols
 * fast implementation from reading articles...
